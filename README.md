# RW Systems

Personal notes on various systems topics (operating systems, distributed systems, databases, networks, etc.).

- Read online: https://rw-systems.ctom3560.workers.dev/
    - If you can not reach the site because of "NXDOMAIN", you can try to switch the DNS server to `1.1.1.1`.
- Or build and read offline locally

These are my unpolished, personal learning notes — **not** intended as polished tutorials or replacements for original books/papers/courses.

## How to build the site locally

```
npx quartz build --serve
```
